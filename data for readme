Support for the errors:

0         Not defined, see error message (if any).
 1         File not found.
 2         Access violation.
 3         Disk full or allocation exceeded.
 4         Illegal TFTP operation.              
 5         Unknown transfer ID.              
 6         File already exists.             Allows overwrite
 7         No such user.                    Deprecated

 
The error simulator can be deployed on the same machine as client, or server. It can also be deployed on a separate machine. However we suggest deploying the error simulator on the same machine as the client.
This server implementation supports overwriting existing files, so no error 6 will ever be expected.

Not allow error code other than the ones noted in RFC1350
Not allowing writing into file being read, not allowing reading into file being written.
Not allowing file being write concurrently
