access violation when a file is open (try with pdf)

need to provide documentation for behavior our system

testing needs to be done for all of the above

would be nice if we can reset the error simulator, ex, press r and it resets the simulator
also implement if the user wants to change ip on client

*********************************************************************************
DONE WITH PARTIAL TESTING:
client asks for destination address
host will have to ask for destination address
inet address getbyname function will throw error on wrong address...needss implementation
delete file for error code 2
client/server make sure that it checks for IP/ and port for error code 5
print message saying "transfer complete" on client/server
2 clients to 1 server,,,,for same file 
make sure error messages are more specific
