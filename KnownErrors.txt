1. During the pre-demo, the TA asked to rename the file after a write to the server. However the file was still in "use" and could not be renamed.
Thus, there's an error that the server is keeping the file open.

2. During the pre-demo, two identical files were written to server, command "fc" in command prompt showed that the files were not the same, ie writing identical files
doesn't work.

3. Need the verbose print statements to follow the guidelines as per project.
