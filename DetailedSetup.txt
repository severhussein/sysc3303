To run Iteration 1:

First import the project following the README.txt in the sysc3303-iteration1 folder.

Once the Project is open in Eclipse:

--------------------------FILE READ/WRITE SECTION--------------------------
-There is a file called acronyms.txt in the folder called ServerFileStorage
-There is a file called acro.txt in the folder called ClientFileStorage
-If you would like to Read a file from the Server, which is option 1 on the client,
for the filename: Enter "acronyms.txt"
-If you would like to Write a file to the Server, which is option 2 on the client,
for the filename: Enter "acro.txt"

At the end of the file transfer, open up the directory where the project is. Then confirm that the new file
is in the correct folder. 
-If you read a file, option 1, then in the folder ClientFileStorage, there should be both acro.txt and acronyms.txt
-If you write a file, option 2, then in the folder ServerFileStorage, there should be both acro.txt and acronyms.txt

This Iteration supports steady state. Thus, you can select option 1, then option 2 successively on the Client.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1- Run the RequestListener:
-The server has two modes, a verbose mode, and a quiet mode
-Entering 1 will toggle between these two modes
-Next, on the Server, enter option 2 to begin running the Server

2- Run the IntHostListener

3- Run the Client:
-Inside the client there are many UI options
-you can toggle between normal and test mode, aswell as quiet and verbose mode
-To read a file, select option 1, but first read the "FILE READ/WRITE SECTION" above
-To write a file, select option 2, but first read the "FILE READ/WRITE SECTION" above
