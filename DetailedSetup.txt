To run Iteration 1:

First import the project following the README.txt in the sysc3303-iteration1 folder.

Once the Project is open in Eclipse:

--------------------------FILE READ/WRITE SECTION--------------------------
-There is a file called acronyms.txt in the folder called clientFileStorage
-There is a file called large_text.txt in the folder called serverFileStorage
-If you would like to Read a file from the Server, which is option 1 on the client,
for the filename: Enter "large_text.txt"
-If you would like to Write a file to the Server, which is option 2 on the client,
for the filename: Enter "acronyms.txt"

At the end of the file transfer, open up the directory where the project is. Then confirm that the new file
is in the correct folder. 
-If you read a file, option 1, then in the folder ClientFileStorage, there should be both acro.txt and acronyms.txt
-If you write a file, option 2, then in the folder ServerFileStorage, there should be both acro.txt and acronyms.txt

This Iteration supports steady state. Thus, you can select option 1, then option 2 successively on the Client.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1- Run the RequestListener:
-The server has two modes, a verbose mode, and a quiet mode
-Entering 1 will toggle between these two modes
-Next, on the Server, enter option 2 to begin running the Server

After the server has begun, at any time you may input the string 'shutdown'
and press enter to terminate the server.

2- Run the IntHostListener
The IntHostListener has a series of modification it can apply to
passing packets. Select one of the options by inputting the number
assoiciated with the error you wish to simulate. After choosing an
error, you may be prompted to enter another positive integer
representing the packet number that the injection will occur at.
The host will print to the console when set-up is complete and
is awaiting for communications between client and server.

3- Run the Client:
-Inside the client there are many UI options
-you can toggle between normal and test mode, aswell as quiet and verbose mode
-To read a file, select option 1, but first read the "FILE READ/WRITE SECTION" above
-To write a file, select option 2, but first read the "FILE READ/WRITE SECTION" above
