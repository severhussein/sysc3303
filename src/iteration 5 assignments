client and host will have to ask for the ip 
client/server make sure that it checks for IP/ and port for error code 5
access violation when a file is open (try with pdf)
inet address getbyname function will throw error on wrong address...needss implementation
delete file for error code 2
need to provide documentation for behavior our system
make sure error messages are more specific
print message saying "transfer complete" on client/server


testing needs to be done for all of the above
2 clients to 1 server,,,,for same file 


would be nice if we can reset the error simulator, ex, press r and it resets the simulator
also implement if the user wants to change ip on client
